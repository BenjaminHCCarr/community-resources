This library provides easy functions for creating dithered rectangles and circles, using either random or ordered dithering.

By using 50% dithering, developers are able to combine every color available in Basalt, resulting in a new color palette
of about 343 different colors. This is possible since 50% dithering is so small that the human eye perceives this as 
a single color.

There are also functions for creating gradients, as well as animated transitions between two colors.
