# Pebble Community Resources

We are putting together a collection of community resources for a new section on the Pebble Developer Website, and we need *your* contributions!

There are three types of content we are looking for: **[Example Apps](#example-apps)**, **[Developer Tools](#developer-tools)**, and **[Libraries](#libraries)**.

To add your resource to the collection, simply [fork this GitHub repository][fork], follow the relevant guide below to create a Markdown file in the right folder, and submit a pull request. 

You can also take a look at some of the resources that have already been submitted to see how to do it.

### Example Apps

We are looking for well-written apps that other people can use to learn Pebble development.

**NOTE:** You must provide an open-source license for your apps in order for it to be approved. The best way to do that is to include a LICENSE file in your app repository.

To add your app, create a new Markdown file in the `apps` folder with the same name as your app (in a URL friendly style, such as `multi-timer.md` or `uk-transport.md`)

At the top of your Markdown file you will need to have a metadata block that contains the following properties:

```
---
name: Multi Timer
creator: Matthew Tole
url: https://github.com/smallstoneapps/multi-timer/
appstore: 52bda40bdc2f4f552e000089
tags:
  - watchapp
  - js
  - storage
---
```

`name`, `creator` and `url` should be self-explanatory. The `appstore` entry is the Pebble appstore ID for your app. If your app isn't on the Pebble appstore, omit this line. The `tags` list will be used on the site to let people browse by different tags. See below for the list of all of the possible tags.

Below this metadata block you should write a description of your app. Include details of the key features your app has.

#### Tags

- `watchapp` - The app is a watchapp
- `watchface` - The app is a watchface
- `android` - The app has an Android companion app
- `ios`- The App has an iOS companion app
- `js` - The app uses PebbleKit JS
- `pebblejs` - The app is written in Pebble.JS
- 'notifications' - The app uses PebbleKit notifications
- `storage` - The app uses ``Persistent Storage``
- `config` - The app has a settings/config page
- 'sensors' - The app uses Pebble sensors
- 'messaging' - The app uses ``AppMessage``, ``AppSync`` or ``DataLogging``
- 'animation' - The app uses ``PropertyAnimation``
- 'graphics' - The app uses Pebble's more advanced graphics/drawing operations

### Developer Tools

To add your tool, create a new Markdown file in the `tools` folder with the same name as your tool (in a URL-friendly style, such as `watchface-generator.md` or `pebble-local-simulator.md`)

At the top of your Markdown file, you will need to have a metadata block that contains the following properties.

```
---
name: Watchface Generator
creator: Paul Rode
url: http://watchface-generator.de
---
```

Below this metadata block you should write a description of your tool.

### Libraries

**NOTE:** You must provide an open-source license for your library in order for it to be approved. The best way to do that is to include a LICENSE file in the repository for your library.

To add your library, create a new Markdown file in the `libraries` folder with the same name as your library (in a URL-friendly style, such as `js-message-queue.md` or `clock-layer.md`).

At the top of your Markdown file you will need to have a metadata block that contains the following properties.


```
---
name: JS Message Queue
creator: Matthew Tole
url: https://github.com/smallstoneapps/js-message-queue/
language: js
---
```

The `language` property should be one of `c`, `js`, `android`, or `ios`. This will help people find your library.

Below the metadata block you should write a description of your library. Talk about what problem it aims to solve and how people should use it.
